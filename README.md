# RawPoints-CurveFit
Polynomial curve fitting for raw data with visualization of this process. 
There are two methods - one based on scikit-learn curve_fit (filenames with m1) and the other one based on numpy polyfit (filenames with m2).

--Procedural programming version--
An example of use is in the files 'loop_m1.py' and 'loop_m2.py'.

--OOP version--
An example of use is in the 'main.py'.

Enjoy!
